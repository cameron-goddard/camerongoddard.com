Hi! I'm Cameron, a software engineer at SpaceX writing software for [Starship](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship). I'm interested in operating systems, as well as UX design and human-computer interaction.

At Cornell, I led software development on the [Cornell Rocketry Team](https://www.cornellrocketryteam.com/). I also worked on flight software for [Alpha CubeSat](https://alphacubesat.cornell.edu/), a satellite project within Cornell's Space Systems Design Studio. Previously, I was the flight software lead for the [Cislunar Explorers CubeSats](https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/cislunar-explorers), another project in the SSDS.

In my free time, I enjoy developing modern and efficient apps for macOS. I'm also interested in vintage computing, baseball, and movies.
