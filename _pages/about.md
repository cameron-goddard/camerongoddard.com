Hi! I'm Cameron, a senior at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science. I am 
interested in systems and networking, particularly operating systems. I'm also passionate about computer science's applications in spaceflight.

Last summer, I worked at SpaceX on software for [Starlink Direct to Cell](https://www.starlink.com/business/direct-to-cell). After graduation, I'll be returning to SpaceX to write flight software for [Starship](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship).

At Cornell, I lead software development on the [Cornell Rocketry Team](https://www.cornellrocketryteam.com/). I'm also working on flight software for [Alpha CubeSat](https://alphacubesat.cornell.edu/), a satellite project within Cornell's Space Systems Design Studio. Previously, I was the flight software lead for the [Cislunar Explorers CubeSat](https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/cislunar-explorers-fe), another project in the SSDS.

In my free time, I enjoy developing modern and efficient apps for macOS. I'm also interested in vintage computing, baseball, and movies.
